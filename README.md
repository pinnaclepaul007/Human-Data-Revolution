# Human or data beings?

Beneath the surface of flesh and bones lies a complex tapestry of information, constantly interacting and evolving. Now, data is a big part of who we are and integral to our existence. We're gradually evolving, and everything about our being is becoming a numerical identifier. As the world evolves, our traditional identifiers (names) are gradually being substituted with codes or numbers that serve as a contemporary representation of our identity.

These numbers or codes (data) circulate in every facet of our lives like blood flowing in our system. In a bid to improve livelihood, promote ease, and enhance security, this plethora of data emanates from technological advancements and their modus operandi. 

# Here are highlights of such…..

Day-to-day human activities are churning out a lot of information about us, reflecting our identity and personality. As such, we don’t take cognisance of the potential of these data. As technological advancement tends to improve livelihoods, we have adopted a unique identifier for our identity rather than the traditional name we’re familiar with. 


# ID Numbers

While different individuals may share names, passport IDs are designed to be unique. The alphanumeric combination in a passport ID serves as a distinct and singular reference, eliminating ambiguity and reducing the risk of identity confusion. The ID acts as a comprehensive snapshot of the individual's identity and is structured to contain the holder’s information, such as nationality, date of birth, gender, and the expiration date of the passport.
Flight tickets are not just documents that grant access to a plane; they are intricate records containing crucial details about the passenger's journey. Flight numbers, departure and arrival codes, and seat assignments collectively provide a comprehensive view of the travel itinerary.


# Credit Cards

In the modern digital age, the significance of unique identifiers such as account numbers, credit card numbers, contact numbers, and driver's licenses cannot be overstated. These alphanumeric combinations are crucial in establishing and verifying individual identities, particularly in financial transactions and communication. Basically, those credit card numbers can fund one’s lifestyle from the comfort of your house. From shopping online, buying a property, booking a flight, owning an asset, and so on.
Membership cards with unique identification codes have become increasingly prevalent across various organisations, extending beyond financial transactions and communication into various spheres of communal and professional life. Religious gatherings, clubhouses, gym centres, and professional bodies have adopted this practice, leveraging the benefits of personalized identification and streamlined membership management.


# Healthcare Industry

The healthcare system generates a plethora of valuable data for diagnosis and treatment through various sensors, imaging technologies, and monitoring devices. These medical equipment, like x-ray machines, MRI, ultrasound machines, smart infusion pumps and ventilators, electrocardiograms, and so on, generate data crucial for healthcare professionals to make accurate diagnoses, monitor patient progress, and tailor treatment plans. Integration of these technologies enables a more comprehensive and data-driven approach to healthcare delivery.


# Internet of Things

The integration of wearable devices, smartphones, and the Internet of Things (IoT) into our daily lives has ushered in an era of unprecedented connectivity and data generation. These technological tools have become not just accessories but integral components that continuously gather, process and transmit vast amounts of data, providing insights into various facets of our lives.
Wearable devices like fitness trackers and smartwatches monitor vital health metrics like heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical activity. This data contributes to a comprehensive understanding of one's health status, enabling individuals to make informed decisions about their well-being.


# Fashion Industry

The fashion industry has increasingly embraced the use of data to enhance the design, production, and marketing of clothing, aiming to create outfits that resonate with consumers. The numerical data represent the human figure beyond the traditional names of individuals. By incorporating data into various facets of the fashion industry, from design to marketing and supply chain management, brands can stay agile, respond to consumer preferences, and produce outfits that align with current trends, creating a more personalised and efficient shopping experience for consumers.


# Social Media

Social Media Interactions: Likes, views, and engagements on social media platforms are governed by algorithms that analyse user behaviour. These algorithms determine the content displayed on users' feeds, creating a feedback loop where the content is tailored to individual interests and preferences.

E-Commerce: Online shopping platforms utilise data to understand consumer preferences, leading to personalised product recommendations. This data-driven approach enhances user satisfaction and promotes a more efficient and enjoyable shopping experience.

These technologies have become integral to our lives, acting as constant data sources that shape our digital experiences.


# Biometrics

Biometrics collects and analyses individuals' unique physical or behavioural characteristics for identification or authentication. While traditional identifiers remain essential, technological advancements are introducing new layers of identity verification. These features can include physiological traits such as fingerprints, facial features, iris patterns, and voiceprints, as well as behavioural traits like typing patterns or how a person walks.
When biometrics is used for data collection, a person's unique characteristics are initially recorded and stored in a secure database. The collected data is then used as a reference for future comparisons. During authentication or identification, a person's biometric data is captured again, and the system compares it with the stored reference data. If there's a match, the person is verified or identified.


# DNA

The genetic code encoded within our DNA is a fundamental form of biological data, containing the instructions that govern living organisms' development, functioning, and inheritance. DNA is a complex and highly organised code that carries hereditary information passed from generation to generation. It serves as a molecular blueprint, encoding the instructions for synthesising proteins and regulating various cellular processes.



Conclusively, there are other areas where data has influenced our endeavours that are not captured in this article. However, in the age of data, humans can be viewed as data repositories that span every aspect of life. Recognising the depth of our data chain opens new avenues for exploring the human experience and underscores the interconnectedness of data in shaping our past, present, and future.
